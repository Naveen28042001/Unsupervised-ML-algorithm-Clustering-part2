    "Hierarchical clustering is a clustering algorithm that groups similar data points into clusters based on the principle of creating a hierarchy of clusters. It does so by either starting with individual data points as clusters and then merging them into larger clusters, or by starting with all data points as one cluster and recursively splitting them into smaller clusters. \n",
